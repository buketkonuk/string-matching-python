# string-matching-python
Finding the matching entry for a list in a target list
The objective is to match the tesdata->'Product Name' column into the correct brand name in the jw.csv file
In jw.csv we have the 'Brand' and the 'Brand Line' columns, and the objective is to match the 
'Product Name' ---> ''Brand Line'

#This type of problem is usually resolved with traditional ETL modules where for each source line, a target is defined and the ETL engine load the necessary loads
